<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This NRM service is part of Common Services tools which provides an Open Source framework for building a map within an application.  The CWM Client can be added to host application web pages to display and interact with maps and spatial data. The NRM Common Web Mapping (CWM) framework provides a simple, powerful and lightweight mapping capability for web-browser based client applications. CWM is integrated with the NRS ISSS service-based architecture.  The client component provides a simple API to let host pages interact with the map to display and manipulate spatial data.</p>
